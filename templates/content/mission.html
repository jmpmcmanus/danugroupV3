        <h4>Mission</h4>
        <div class="dg-text">
DanuGroup, is a non-profit that examines the interplay between environmental issues, technological solutions, and 
political policy.  The aim is to give the public in-depth views on topics that directly effect them, providing the 
information in an interactive form, so they can understand the topic from their personal perspective. DanuGroup, 
will encourage the public to comment and even collaborate on these investigations, by being transparent, and by 
providing enabling tools for the public to better understand the issues and make comments.

The approach to the investigations will be comprehensive, taking into consideration historical changes and 
alternative views, as well as the evolutionary potential, and societal impact of the subject being investigated. 
The aim is to come to a common paradigm or model, through analysis of the current state, in relation to the past, 
and possible future.
